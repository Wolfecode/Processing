# Processing
My early work with Processing 2 building simple image manipulations and arcade style games.

# How to see projects:
Download individual folders that seem interesting and run them with Processing. 

# Best Projects:
Starfield was one of the first things I ever build with code. It is a fun arcade style game.
Shapez is another great game to play.
Bloom and Modern_Art go really well together.
